### 1. *Objective:*
   - Develop a weather forecasting application.
   - Use a weather API to retrieve data.
   - Display the weather information in a user-friendly format.

### 2. *Requirements:*
   - *API Integration:* Choose and integrate a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or similar) to fetch the forecast data.
   - *Programming Language:* The task might require the use of a specific programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) depending on the project setup.
   - *Data Display:* Parse the retrieved data and present it in a readable format, such as a web page, console output, or mobile app interface.
   - *Error Handling:* Implement error handling for issues like network errors, API key issues, or data unavailability.
   - *Version Control:* Use Git for version control, with the code hosted on GitHub.

### 3. *Steps:*
   1. *Set Up the Project:*
      - Initialize a Git repository.
      - Set up the project structure (directories, files).
   2. *API Integration:*
      - Obtain an API key (if required).
      - Write code to send requests to the weather API and retrieve data.
   3. *Data Parsing:*
      - Parse the JSON or XML response from the API to extract relevant weather details (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
   4. *Data Display:*
      - Format the extracted data and display it in a user-friendly manner.
   5. *Testing:*
      - Test the application with different locations and weather conditions.
   6. *Documentation:*
      - Document the code and provide instructions on how to set up and run the application.
   7. *Version Control:*
      - Regularly commit changes to GitHub with descriptive commit messages.
      - Use branches for feature development and merge them after testing.

### 4. *Additional Features (Optional):*
   - *User Input:* Allow the user to input a location to get the forecast for that specific area.
   - *UI/UX Enhancements:* If itâ€™s a web or mobile app, consider adding a user interface with styling or interactive elements.
   - *Caching:* Implement caching to reduce API calls for frequently requested data.
   - *Unit Testing:* Write unit tests for the key functions of the application.
